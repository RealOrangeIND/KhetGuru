KhetGuru will be a pioneering agricultural project to transform farming practices through the integration of technology and
community support. This innovative initiative combines soil sensors, data analytics, and a community-driven mobile application to
optimize crop selection and promote knowledge sharing among farmers.

This repository is NOT a part of the actual KhetGuru project and has been created for introducing others to our mission and
accomplishments.

This repository has been created and is maintained and controlled solely by Vedant Ray.
